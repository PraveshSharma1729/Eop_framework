# Eop_framework 
Code for the monitoring and calibration of the ECAL with E/p    


NOTE     
 - skeleton of this repository is forked from https://github.com/abenagli/TTHAnalysis.git    
 - algorithm and function are basically a reorganization of ECALELF/EOverPCalibration codes displaced in different branches:      
    - more updated version of calibration code: https://github.com/lbrianza/ECALELF      
    - more updated version of	monitoring code:  https://gitlab.cern.ch/vciriolo/ECALELF/tree/eop      
    - master of ECALELF:                        https://gitlab.cern.ch/shervin/ECALELF      
 - this code uses the very useful CfgManager class cloned from https://github.com/simonepigazzini/CfgManager to parse options from file
